## Reflection

This was my Final-Year-Project titled "TOURIST ATTRACTION FINDER APPLICATION FOR PERSON WITH DISABILITY (PWD)". The application is developed to assist tourists with disabilities in order for them to locate tourist attractions in Malaysia. This project focuses mainly in the area of Kuala Lumpur as it is the main attraction for international and local tourists. The full report on the project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pzDiOojLh5lCrdhtYEeg21Cvbzn9t-pL/view?usp=sharing).

Upon developing the project, I went through a lot of researches as I was new to React Native. I had to make researches on accessibility features and how to make sure the interface can be utilized by disable people. I wanted to make sure the product is fully functional and can be used by people with disabilities. 

I can conclude that building an application that includes accessibility features is quite challenging as there are not as many examples or reference to follow compared to a normal application. Although it was quite difficult, developing features for the disabled is a must for every development of mobile application. We live in a world where everyone owns a smartphone device, including disabled people. In order to include them as a user, developers must learn on how to build mobile applications around their requirements.
